# Scraping FIFA World Cup Data

As part of the [FIFA Design Hackathon](http://blog.gramener.com/1531/fifa-world-cup-design-hackathon)
we built this
[scraper](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sanand0/fifadata/blob/master/matches.ipynb) to pull every world cup's result from
[linguasport.com](http://www.linguasport.com/futbol/internacional/mundial/seekff.asp).
This also includes who scored each goal and when, along with which player was booked and when.

This is still work-in-progress.


# Key data sources
